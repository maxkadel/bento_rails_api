            "J. O. Ebert\nThe death of J. O. Ebert on December 14 in London\ncame as a shock to me. We met him and his wife Mona\nin July 1987. Sonny Ebert was his usual self: the dedicated\nphotographer, the sincere and trusted friend, the man with\na heart as big as the world. The former Shipping Master’s\nsharp mind, infectious laughter and the gift of turning out\na polished English phrase made J O. Ebert an unforget-\ntable personality.\nIn the 50’s and 60’s Sonny Ebert played an important\nrole in forming a local group called “The Penguins’. Radio\nafid stage plays became part of the apostolate of the\nChurch, although women were banned from taking part\nin’ these. Sonny Ebert helped in bridging the gap and ef-\nfecting a transition that allowed women to take an active\npart in all productions. He was the guiding light in the”\nproduction of ‘The Pontine Marshes’ and ‘The Song of\nBernadette’, which Arthur Van Langenberg produced at\nSt, Peter’s College stage.\nAs dedicated lay apostle Joe and his wife Mona (nee\n' Ephraums) foreshadowed Vatican 2’s renewal, which gave\na' boost to the lay apostolate.\nAs a photographer Sonny Ebert had few equals. With\nhis contemporaries Lionel Wendt, B. J. Thornley, P\nDurrant, B. P. Weerawardena, Quintus Fernando and\nNihal Fernando, he put the ‘Ceylon Photographic Society’\non a firm footing. Sonny Ebert’s photographs were ac- |\ncepted and hung in more than twenty international salons.\nThe encomiums from world photographers, including\nKarsh of Ottawa, were many. Ebert perfected the per-\nformance of the then popular Rolleiflex. He was a master\nof light and shade, of the soft touch to inaeePe and of\nportraits that oozed personality.\n“ After migrating to England Sonny Ebert Pty gave his\nexpertise in the formation of many photographic clubs. A\nday berore he died, he wrote a letter to me thanking me for\nthe photographs I took of him when we were in England.\nHe observed: “The advent of the automatic camera now\navailable at low prices, is a boon to some - a pitfall to the\nserious photographer.”\nMay he rest in peace.\nNoel Crusz\nA. M. M. Allahudeen\n» The demise of Mr. A. M. M. Allahudeen in Kuru-\nnegala, who was born in Beruwela was a shock and\nbrought grief to all— who knew him. He was the eldest\nson of the late Mr. A. L. A. Majeed of the District\nCourt of Ratnapura. %\n“Mr. Allahudeen had his early education at St.\nAloysius College, Ratnapura. He was the first scholar\nto pass out as an Attorney-at-Law from the Ceylon\nMuslim Scholarship Fund. He showed keen interest in\nthe activitics of the YMMA Islamic Radio Artistes’\nAssociation and various Meeladun-Nabi Celebration\n_ » Committees. He was the Trustee of the Jennath\nMosque, Ratnapura..\n26 He started his practice at Ratnapura courts and later\nserved as President, Rural Courts, Addl. Magistrate,\nRegistrar High Court, Probate Officer, Judge, Primary\nCourt and retired while at Kurunegala.\nMr. Allahudeen was a man of rare qualities. A\n“loving husband and father. He was a good friend and\nwas admired by all.\n., May these sentiments at least bring some consolation -\nto his family.\nMay Inna Lillah V Allah grant him Jennathul Fird-\nT.G.S. Goonewardene\nDeath laid his icy hand on TGS (as he was fondly called\nby his numerous past pupils, colleagues and admirers) so\nsuddenly that quite'a number were unaware of his de-\nparture to a still better life. He was such a staunch believer\nin the next life that he held all the Buddhist precepts, all\nten of them, even though a layman, most sacred, and\nfollowed them to the letter.\nIf one were to talk of TGS’ achievements, three stand\nout clear: he was one of the most talented and informed of\n_ English teachers; he was one of the most successful of\nschool Principals during the formative y yeats of education\nin Sri Lanka, 1952 to 1972; he was prior to that a pioneer\n, in the Buddhist educational regeneration. In the first; his’\ncharisma lay in unostentatious, undemonstrative attach-\nment to the pupils and his own untiring efforts to learn the °\nsubject better. He oriented his teaching of English to the\nSinhala background of the pupil.\nIn the second, he said his success lay in the adage\nchanged by him, “Let not ambition mock my toil ... I want .\nall teachers to work with satisfaction, not for me to seek\npromotions for myself.” (He was for 20 years the Principal\nof the Training College Practising School, which he left as\na progressing Central School).\nIn the third, he was an able lieutenant of Dr. E. W.\nAdikaram, and had not the BTS schools been nationalised,\nTGS would have headed one of the leading Buddhist\nCollege with acceptance, with dignity and with progress.\nOne could think of his personal pleasant qualities wi-\nthout end, but I should like to refer to another diaension\nof a person’s worth - his family life. In this dimension,\nTGS was exemplary. He had a most contented family\ngroup. A visit to his home would teach you, many pages\nfrom the Buddhist pattern of living, and you could say to\nyourself (or even loudly) “Here’s virtue extolled by the\nBuddha in the Mangala Sutta, .... Isn’t this what the\nBuddha exhorted Sigala to do .... This is the typical upa-\nsaka way of life...” and so on. Personally I can think of\nsuch a lot | imbibed from him to shape my own life. I can\nrecall them as chunks of real life, not simply when I’m in\n“vacant or pensive mood” but in the course of my daily\nactions.\nTGS always thought of a better life to be, to go higher:\nand higher in evolution, as good Buddhists do. And\nhaving lived to fit this task would now be in a blaze of\nglory and happiness somewhere treading the path to\nNirvana. H. D. J. Gunawardene\nPamela\nA queen is a queen\nThough she lies in the dust\nNever did she demean\nOr stoop to low down act\nHolding her head high .\nSerenaded her realms with pride\nAustere, sincere, reserved, conservative\nBut she was never, never proud.\nPamela my dear wife\nFought a great battle for life\nSuffered as no other did.\nAnd braved the pains of flesh and blood\n.

Father Michael Rodrigo\nI was to have been with Father Michael Rodrigo and\nthe Sisters who worked with him at Suba Seth Gedara in\nAlukalavita near Buttala that week However, a bullet,\nfired at point blank range, shattered the upper part of\nFather Michael’s head and everything changed. It was yet\nOne more manifestation of the many-headed beast of\nviolence here.\nLast January, I had also shared their life, meals and\nworship. I came away deeply moved, feeling that I had\ntouched something incredibly precious in Sri Lankan life.\nI went there as an English woman, a Christian, here, for\ntwo years to study Buddhism. Father Michael was killed\nwhilst giving the blessing at the end of Mass, “In church”\nsome reports have written. Yet, the church was his living\nroom in a house made of wattle and daub, with no elec-\ntricity or piped water. There would have been no con-\ngregation in the normal sense of the word — just Father\nMichael and the Sisters, holding the village before God,\nwithout gilt, gold or ceremony, in quiet, lamplit darkness.\nFather Michael called Suba Seth Gedara,\na “Buddhist Christian Dialogue Fellowship Vil-\nlage Effort”. yet, each word was important. “Only after\ndialogue of ‘life is there dialogue of prayer and then of\nreligious experience’, he wrote. No converts were made in\nthe village. That had never been his intention. His was\nnot the kind of “mission” usually associated with\nChristianity.. Never had he tried to threaten the beliefs of\n_ the people with whom he lived. What motivated him\nwelled from a different and perhaps deeper level of spi-,\nrituality.\nWhilst I stayed at Suba Seth Gedara, Father Michael\ndid not touch on what divided Buddhism and Christianity\nbut only on what united them. “Metta”, he pointed out,\ni\nwas from the Pali word mejjati” — to melt. It was a\nmelting of the heart in loving kindness to all. Christianity,\non the other hand, spoke of “compassion”, a translation of\nthe Greek word meaning “mercy welling from the bo-\nwels”. Both, he felt, had kindred roots. Father Michael\nembodied metta, compassion and joy.\n“We are part of the village. We become the poor also”,\nSister Benedict had said to me. “Those around us are\nvoiceless, landless and powerless”, Father Michael had\nstressed. “‘They provide rice for the nation and yet find\nthemselves indebted half the year”. What was being done\nat Suba Seth Gedara, however, was more than what is\ncomfortably called social work. He and the Sister certainly\nhelped the villagers. Health workers were trained, nutri-\ntious farm plots encouraged, a medical herb garden de-\nveloped, English taught and cultural evenings held. Ho-\nwever, the true message of Father Michael’s work does not\nlie in his but in his lifestyle and spirituality and the\nchallenge this poses to people of all faiths.\nTo Christians, he posed the radical challenge of God’s\npreference for the poor and those considered weak. He\ncalled Buddhists to look closely at what ‘anatta’ and\n‘Sangha’ mean in social life.\nAs I visited the villagers and was taken to meet the\nmonks at nearby Buddhist temples, I was struck by the\nwarmth shown to us. There was not a trace of the sus-\npicion which so often characterises a Christian presence in\na Buddhist environment. We walked or used the bus, of\ncourse. I could not have imagined Father Michael ever _\nbeing persuaded to buy a car or build a house in materials\ndifferent from his neighbours. :\nA eK Elizabeth Harris ©"

When ‘therefore, to confider\nand compute the Charge on either fide, we profit\nby what wetranfport fix to one 5 which makes\nthe Spaziard generally fo poor in the Jndses, and\nwe generally to flourifh fo much the more.\nThe third Reafon is, That in a Ship of Three\nhundred Tun, the Spzviards have feldom lefs than\ntwo hundred Men belonging to her,and the Wages\neach Man comes to at leaft Fifty Shillings jrerling\nper Month, which, inthe whole, amounts to Five\nhundred Pounds a Month, barely for Wages 3\nthen you are to confider the Monthly Provifions, to\naccommodate thefe Men, cannot come to lefs than\nOne hundred and fifty Pounds frerling ; and Ten\nMonths,at Six hundred and fifty Pounds per Month,\namounts to Six thoufand and five hundred Pounds\nftirling for Ten Months. Moreover, this Ship of\nThree hundred Tun, feldom carries lefs than Forty\n-Pieces of Ordnance, which withtheir Provifions,@c.\nby modeft.computation, takes upnolefs room than\nOne hundred and fifty Tun; fo that the Ship, in\nall probability, cannot bring home more than One\nhundred and fifty Tun of Merchants Goods, and\nthe Freight of thefe Goods comes to Forty Pounds\nfierling a Tun, to pay Ware and Tare of the Ship\narid Mens Wages; fo that forthe Ship’s Ware and\nTare, it comes barely but to One hundred and fifty\nPounds fterling clear.\nNow admit an Englifh Ship of Three hundred\nTun, be bound for Fam: “ica, and fuppofe the\nS Freight",
            "(258 )\nFreight of this Ship be at Six Pounds ferling per\nTun, this Ship fhall make her Voyage better in\nEight Months time than the Spaniard fhall-in Ten\nMonths; now the Freight of the Englifh Ship\ncomes to One thoufand eight hundred Pounds fter-\nding, and the Wages and Victuals of the faid Ship,\nat Sixty Pounds per Month, comes to Four hundred\nand eighty Pounds fferling ; fothat you fee the Ship\nclears, for her Ware and Tare, the fumof One\nthonfand three hundred and twenty Pounds frerling.\nSce here therefore the great difference. |\n‘The fourth and laft reafon is this; The King of\nSpain contracts with a body of Merchants, to fur-\nnifh the West-Indies with Four thoufand Negroes\nevery Year, and the Nigrilloes, or Merchants, there\nengage to pay the King one hundred Pieces of Eight |\nCuftom for each Negro-flave brought unto them ;\nwhich comes to Four hundred thoufand Pieces of\nEight by the Year, which is paid to the faid King ;\nthe King therefore prohibits, all Merchants and\nothers, for bringing Negroes to the West- Indies ;\nand each Piece of Eight is valued at Five Shillings\nfeerling in Barbadoes, but in the Leeward Iflands it\ngoes for fix,\nRUdifs, 9\nWilt the f\nRt One",

[BLOME (Richard)] The Present State of His Majesties Isles and\nTerritories in America viz. Jamaica, Barbados, S. Christophers, Nevis, Antego, S. Vincent,\nDominica, New Jersey, Pensilvania, Monserat, Anguilla, Bermudas, Carolina, Virginia, New\nEngland, Tobago, New Found Land, Mary Land, New York. . Together with Astronomical\nTables, which will serve as a constant Diary or Calendar for the Use of the English Inhabitants\nin those Islands from 1686 to 1700 . . And how to make Sun Dials fitting for all those places,\nwith the large folding engraved map of Jamaica (other islands included) and the 6 other\nengraved small folding maps, of Barbados, North-East America to Greenland and Iceland,\nBermuda, Carolina, Virginia and Maryland, etc., New England and New York, and the\nengraved folded plate of suggested dials for New England, Barbados, Jamaica, Virginia,\nCarolina, all maps in fine state, FIRST EDITION, 8vo. pp.[8]; 262; [36]; adverts.6; without the\nportrait of James II or free front fly-leaf, but a very nice copy in contemporary mottled calf\n(slight wear to front hinge), the Macclesfield copy with the North Library bookplate,\ncontemporary manuscript notes in top and upper fore-margin dated 1687 apparently referring\nto reviews, H. Clark for Dorman Newman, 1687 Y 1G = $36 bE £2350.00\nThe dispute between William Penn and Lord Baltimore ‘regarding the Pennsylvania -\nMaryland boundary was at its height when James II came to the throne in 1685, bringing\ndanger to the security of the American possessions. The liberal Charter of Maryland was\nespecially odious to the King who, in April 1687, tried to have it annulled, but his instructions\nnever arrived. This extremely important work includes two long contemprary letters from Penn\n1683-85, [pages 91-133] providing a-most excellent description of the Province of\nPennsylvania, the land, the natives and the planters, and the prospects. All the other places\nalso have excellent descriptions. At the end are the monthly astronomical tables even wa a\nsection on how to make Sun-Dials for all those remote parts.\nAlthough without the portrait (as is sometimes the case) and the front fly leaf, this is\na very clean copy of a most desirable book.

The\ndirections that were to be taken were quite clear\nand even then the rapidity and the scale at which\nthe existing framework is being unraveled has\ntaken most by surprise.\nThe Prime Minister has lost no\nopportunity to express his government’s\ncommitment to ‘growth and development’ and\nto laying out the red carpet for the corporate\nworld from around the globe to roll in; one of\nthe most common refrains of the environment\nand forest minister has been that the\nenvironment won’t become an impediment in\nthe country’s growth trajectory even as he\nspouts homilies on protection, on India’s\ncommitment to arresting climate change and on\nwildlife conservation; and no stone is being left\nunturned where projects on the ground are\nconcerned, either.\nWe saw the magnitude of this thrust\n(and the callousness, too) in the pushing through\nof nearly 140 projects that were before the\nNational Board for Wildlife for clearance (see\npg. 12 for the full list) and in the fact that in the\nfirst 100 days of the government the Forest\nAdvisory and Expert Appraisal Committees\ncombined cleared 240 projects listed before\nthem for approval. We are seeing this further in\nthe constitution and mandate of the high level\ncommittee (HLC) to re-look at five environment\nand forests related laws — all in two months “so\nas to bring them in line with current\nrequirements to meet objectives”. The powers of\nthe National Green Tribunal are likely to be\ndiluted, the Forest Rights Act is to be diluted,\nthe environment impact assessment (EIA)\nnotification is being toned down, provisions for\nforest diversion under the Forest Conservation\nAct are being relaxed and a desire has been\nexpressed to amend the Right to Fair\nCompensation and Transparency in Land\nAcquisition, Rehabilitation and Resettlement\nAct (RFCLARR), 2013.\nTo say that social, socio-economic and\necological concerns are being given the go-by\nwould be a gross understatement. This is an\nunprecedented assault and one that’s coming\nfrom all fronts. The environment and those\ncalling for environmental and social concern are\nbeing berated as impediments and _ speed-\nbreakers.\nWe need to remember, however, that\nspeed not controlled and moderated breaks\nnecks ruthlessly. It’s called breakneck speed!\nThis is not to say that the trajectory of economic\ngrowth and development we have taken at the\nmoment is the right one and that it only needs\nmoderation. We certainly need fundamental re-\nthinking and while we do that, the proponents of\nspeed might want to carefully weigh their\noptions — do they want broken necks or would\nthey rather prefer some moderation? The choice\nshould be an obvious one.\nNEWS FROM INDIAN STATES\nProtected Area Update Vol. XX, No. 5\nOctober 2014 (No. 111)\nHIMACHAL PRADESH\nVillagers oppose eco-sensitive zone around\nBinsar WLS\nThe villagers of the area surrounding the Binsar\nWildlife Sanctuary have opposed the declaration\nof an eco-sensitive zone within a 10 km radius\nof the sanctuary.

Since 2011 as many as 78 pairs\nwere given to various defence units, including\nthe Madras Regiment, Rajputana Rifles and\nGarhwal Rifles. The state has an ivory stockpile\nof 2,200 pairs seized from poachers or collected\nfrom natural elephant deaths. In Karnataka, until\nApril 2014, requests for tusks for defence units\ncould only be made by the Ministry of Defence.\nThe state government recently eased access to\ntusks by allowing requisitions directly from\ndefence officers ‘not below the rank of a\nColonel’ for their regiments. Hundreds of\n- requests have been made by defence units\nacross the country seeking tusks to put up in\ntheir messes and halls.\nThe Ministry of Environment and\nForests had, in 1994, asked all states to destroy\ntheir ivory stockpiles, adding, however, that\nsome specimens could be kept aside for\nresearch, education or be given to government\ninstitutions. These tusks are acquired free of\ncost because selling and buying Asian ivory is\nbanned internationally as well as in the country.\nEnvironmentalists have pointed out that\nto put up elephant tusks serves to commodify\nthe species, and, sends out the wrong message.\nThe Mysore-based Nature Conservation\nFoundation has said that a trophy-style display\nof elephant tusks — even if they are legally\nProtected Area Update Vol. XX, No. 5\nOctober 2014 (No. 111)",
            "acquired — contradicts the spirit of the ivory-\ntrade ban that aims to discourage poaching and\nthe use of ivory in any way.\nA senior defence officer concurred with\nthis view, saying that it is unethical to display\nmaterial that has been declared illegal in the\ncountry, and, highly priced items like ivory\ncould find their way into the civilian market.\nEcologist at the Centre for Ecological Sciences,\nIndian Institute of Science, R. Sukumar, said\nthat procuring tusks through the Ministry of\nDefence would have at least made tracking\nthese pieces easier, whereas it is difficult to\nstock-take ivory that is scattered across the\ncountry without a centralised system in place.\nSource: Divya Gandhi, ‘Karnataka’s ivory given\naway to armed forces’, The Hindu,\n25/08/14.\nDisplaced tribals of Rajiv Gandhi\n(Nagarhole) NP become landless labour\nA three-member Karnataka High Court\ncommittee has pointed out that a majority of the\ntribal families displaced from the Rajiv Gandhi\n(Nagarhole) National Park area in three taluks\nof Mysore and Kodagu districts have become\nlandless agricultural labourers. The committee,\nheaded by Muzaffar Assadi, Professor at\nUniversity of Mysore, was asked ‘to look into\nthe actual number of families and persons who\nhad to move on account of establishment of the\n. park’.\nThe committee, in its report titled “On —\nthe tribal issues of Rajiv Gandhi (Nagarhole)\nNational Park Area’ (July 2014), which was\nsubmitted to the High Court and to the state\ngovernment, revealed that families cultivating\nland have not been able to obtain formal credit\nowing to allotment of bagair hukum and gomal\nland. It noted that only 24.54 per cent of the\ndisplaced tribal families owned land and that the\nsmall size of their land-holdings had failed to\nalleviate them from poverty.\nTribes such as the Jenu Kuruba, Soliga,\nYerava, Betta Kuruba and Paniyara Yerava\nwere most affected by the displacement. Denial\nof formal credit had also forced the tribal folk to\nfall back on private lenders for loans in the form\nof seeds and fertilizers, creating the possibility\nof perpetual indebtedness, the report said.\nSource: Nagesh Prabhu, ‘Displaced tribals landless\nand poor: panel’, The Hindu, 11/08/14.\nContact: Dy.

            "PERSPECTIVE\nGiving the otter its due |\nThree species of otters occur on the Indian\nsubcontinent - the Eurasian otter Lutra lutra,\nthe Smooth-coated otter Lutrogate perspicillata\nand the Oriental small-clawed otter Aonyx\ncinerea. The Smooth-coated otter is distributed\nthroughout the country from the Himalayas\nsouthward, but the other two are restricted to\nthe Himalayas, north of the Ganges and to\nsouthern India, with recent records of the\nOriental small-clawed otter from streams in\nEastern India. In north-west India, otters have\nbeen reported from the Kashmir valley, from\nthe Trans Himalayan region of Ladakh and also\nfrom Himachal Pradesh.\nThe existing populations of otter\nspecies in India and their habitat have been\nsporadically surveyed and evidence seems to\nsuggest that in the north. Indian plains, in\nparticular, they have either become extinct or\nare getting extremely rare outside the protected\nareas. The Nityata Foundation has been\nstudying the occurrence, habitat and\ndistribution of the Oriental small-clawed otter\nand the Smooth coated otter along the Cauvery\nriver, with the objective of developing a long\nterm conservation plan for the species in the\nriver. We believe that the otters are\nambassadors of river and stream ecosystems\nand any intervention to save the species will\nonly have positive benefits for all.\nIn the last two years, the research\nteam has learnt of a number of threats that\notters, and indeed all river wildlife face: the\nmining of sand, dynamite fishing, a heavy\npollution load on the river from towns\nalongside it, as well as chemical pesticide\nresidues in the water. and opportunistic\npoaching. Extensive interaction with the\nfisherfolk has shown that the dominant lens of\nviewing otters is one of hostility, or at best,\nneutrality.\nThis is something that needed\nimmediate attention. The conservation plan that\nwe are working on therefore involves both\neggagement with the local fisherfolk and children\nin schools and of using theatre and interactive\nmedia to highlight the role of the otter as one of\nthe apex predators in the riverine ecosystem.\nSubsequently, the conservation plan will include\na campaign against dynamite fishing, and on\naddressing some of the issues of pollution along\nthe river. The project is in close informal\ndialogue with the Fisheries Department, which is\none of the key stakeholders in the river’s health.\n- Gopakumar Menon is associated with\nthe Bengaluru based\nNityata Foundation.\nEmail: gopakumar.rootcause@gmail.com\nog\nFor private circulation/ Printed matter\nFrom\nKalpavriksh\nApt. 5, Sri Dutta Krupa\n908 Deccan Gymkhana\nPune 411004\n400 Tea IND,\n“rjee United States\n* Congress American\nProtected Area Update Vol. XX, No. 5\n“9 Gandhi Marg\n—~"
