        "A report on agricultural expansion, environmental concerns in tropical forests, and poverty reduction, and how ecological, economic, and political aspects of tropical forests vary widely at both large and small scales. The spatial variation in deforestation and forest poverty is confronted by the author and the integration of results from recent econometric studies along with institutional studies finds that there is weak evidence of a causal link between deforestation and poverty, challenging conventional wisdom. Tables, Figures, Appendixes, References.",
        "There are many causes, consequences, and\u000aconnections of deforestation and forest poverty in the\u000atropical world. This report specifically addresses the\u000apotential dilemma of trade-offs between poverty reduction\u000aand environmental protection. It seeks to improve the\u000adiagnosis of forest problems and facilitate the prescription\u000aand application of solutions by focusing on both the causes\u000aand consequences of forest conversion to agriculture and on\u000athe nature and location of forest poverty. The first section\u000ais diagnostic, examining the drivers and consequences of\u000adeforestation and forest poverty. The second part looks at\u000ahow governance, institutions, and policies shape those\u000adrivers. It identifies opportunities for win-win policies.\u000aIn particular, anything that boosts labor demand outside\u000aagriculture will tend to reduce both poverty and\u000adeforestation. Additionally, promotion of some kinds of\u000aagroforestry can help to improve the ecological functions of\u000adegraded forests while boosting farm output and employment.\u000aThe report offers a systematic framework for thinking about\u000ahow to integrate forest management with rural development in\u000aa sustainable way."
