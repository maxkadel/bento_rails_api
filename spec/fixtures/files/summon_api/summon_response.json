        "In 1994, the Government of Cameroon\u000aintroduced an array of forest policy reforms, both\u000aregulatory and market-based, to support a more organized,\u000atransparent, and sustainable system for accessing and using\u000aforest resources. This report describes how these reforms\u000aplayed out in the rainforests of Cameroon. The intention is\u000ato provide a brief account of a complex process and identify\u000awhat worked, what did not, and what can be improved. The\u000abarriers to placing Cameroon's forests at the service\u000aof its people, its economy, and the environment originated\u000awith the extractive policies of successive colonial\u000aadministrations. The barriers were further consolidated\u000aafter independence through a system of political patronage\u000aand influence in which forest resources became a coveted\u000acurrency for political support. These deeply entangled\u000acommercial and political interests have only recently, and\u000areluctantly, started to diverge. In 1994, the government\u000aintroduced an array of forest policy reforms, both\u000aregulatory and market based. The reforms changed the rules\u000adetermining who could gain access to forest resources, how\u000aaccess could be obtained, how those resources could be used,\u000aand who will benefit from their use. This report assesses\u000athe outcomes of reforms in forest-rich areas of Cameroon,\u000awhere the influence of industrial and political elites has\u000adominated since colonial times."

        "In 1994, the Government of Cameroon\u000aintroduced an array of forest policy reforms, both\u000aregulatory and market-based, to support a more organized,\u000atransparent, and sustainable system for accessing and using\u000aforest resources. This report describes how these reforms\u000aplayed out in the rainforests of Cameroon. The intention is\u000ato provide a brief account of a complex process and identify\u000awhat worked, what did not, and what can be improved. The\u000abarriers to placing Cameroon's forests at the service\u000aof its people, its economy, and the environment originated\u000awith the extractive policies of successive colonial\u000aadministrations. The barriers were further consolidated\u000aafter independence through a system of political patronage\u000aand influence in which forest resources became a coveted\u000acurrency for political support. These deeply entangled\u000acommercial and political interests have only recently, and\u000areluctantly, started to diverge. In 1994, the government\u000aintroduced an array of forest policy reforms, both\u000aregulatory and market based. The reforms changed the rules\u000adetermining who could gain access to forest resources, how\u000aaccess could be obtained, how those resources could be used,\u000aand who will benefit from their use. This report assesses\u000athe outcomes of reforms in forest-rich areas of Cameroon,\u000awhere the influence of industrial and political elites has\u000adominated since colonial times."

        "Despite the vast number of books and reports on tropical deforestation, there's confusion about the causes of forest loss and forest poverty, and the effectiveness of policy responses. At Loggerheads seeks to describe ways to reconciles pressures for agricultural expansion in the tropics with the urgent needs for both forest conservation and poverty alleviation. It diagnoses the causes and impacts of forest loss and the reasons for the association of forests and poverty. It looks at how policies - modulated by local conditions - act simultaneously on deforestation and poverty, creating tradeoffs or complementarities, depending on the situation. The report brings to the surface problems that impede adoption of favourable policies, describing institutional and technological innovations that might help overcome these impediments.",
        "There are many causes, consequences, and\u000aconnections of deforestation and forest poverty in the\u000atropical world. This report specifically addresses the\u000apotential dilemma of trade-offs between poverty reduction\u000aand environmental protection. It seeks to improve the\u000adiagnosis of forest problems and facilitate the prescription\u000aand application of solutions by focusing on both the causes\u000aand consequences of forest conversion to agriculture and on\u000athe nature and location of forest poverty. The first section\u000ais diagnostic, examining the drivers and consequences of\u000adeforestation and forest poverty. The second part looks at\u000ahow governance, institutions, and policies shape those\u000adrivers. It identifies opportunities for win-win policies.\u000aIn particular, anything that boosts labor demand outside\u000aagriculture will tend to reduce both poverty and\u000adeforestation. Additionally, promotion of some kinds of\u000aagroforestry can help to improve the ecological functions of\u000adegraded forests while boosting farm output and employment.\u000aThe report offers a systematic framework for thinking about\u000ahow to integrate forest management with rural development in\u000aa sustainable way.",

The spatial variation in deforestation and forest poverty is confronted by the author and the integration of results from recent econometric studies along with institutional studies finds that there is weak evidence of a causal link between deforestation and poverty, challenging conventional wisdom.

        "This policy note was prepared in\u000aresponse to a request from the Government of Southern Sudan\u000a(GoSS) for World Bank assistance in developing legislative\u000aand institutional policies and strategies that will take\u000aadvantage of the potential of the region's forest\u000aresources to contribute to poverty alleviation, food\u000asecurity, sustainable agriculture, economic growth, and to\u000aprotection of forest-related environmental services such as\u000aclimate, biodiversity, water, and wildlife resources. The\u000anote is intended to: (a) take stock of the current situation\u000aon the ground, including identifying the legislative,\u000ainstitutional, governance, and policy reforms needed to\u000acreate an enabling environment for both public and\u000aprivate-sector investment. This should help in contributing\u000ato improved understanding of the currently underutilized\u000apotential of Southern Sudan's forest resources; (b)\u000aanalyze what has worked and what has not worked prior to and\u000asince the signing of the Comprehensive Peace Agreement\u000a(CPA); and (c) suggest priority solutions and actions\u000atowards revitalizing the forestry sector. Key policy issues\u000aaddressed in this note include: 1) strengthening forest\u000aresource information and knowledge base; 2) developing a\u000acoherent legislative and policy framework, organizational\u000astructure, and capacity for the sector; 3) promoting\u000aparticipatory forest and woodland management; 4) enabling\u000aforest-based industries to thrive; 5) creating an enabling\u000aenvironment for attracting private-sector investment; 6)\u000aprotecting and enhancing forest-related environmental\u000aservices; 7) using technical approaches to conservation and\u000asustainable management of forest resources; and 8)\u000aintroducing predictable and sustainable long-term financing mechanisms."

        "This policy note was prepared in\u000aresponse to a request from the Government of Southern Sudan\u000a(GoSS) for World Bank assistance in developing legislative\u000aand institutional policies and strategies that will take\u000aadvantage of the potential of the region's forest\u000aresources to contribute to poverty alleviation, food\u000asecurity, sustainable agriculture, economic growth, and to\u000aprotection of forest-related environmental services such as\u000aclimate, biodiversity, water, and wildlife resources. The\u000anote is intended to: (a) take stock of the current situation\u000aon the ground, including identifying the legislative,\u000ainstitutional, governance, and policy reforms needed to\u000acreate an enabling environment for both public and\u000aprivate-sector investment. This should help in contributing\u000ato improved understanding of the currently underutilized\u000apotential of Southern Sudan's forest resources; (b)\u000aanalyze what has worked and what has not worked prior to and\u000asince the signing of the Comprehensive Peace Agreement\u000a(CPA); and (c) suggest priority solutions and actions\u000atowards revitalizing the forestry sector. Key policy issues\u000aaddressed in this note include: 1) strengthening forest\u000aresource information and knowledge base; 2) developing a\u000acoherent legislative and policy framework, organizational\u000astructure, and capacity for the sector; 3) promoting\u000aparticipatory forest and woodland management; 4) enabling\u000aforest-based industries to thrive; 5) creating an enabling\u000aenvironment for attracting private-sector investment; 6)\u000aprotecting and enhancing forest-related environmental\u000aservices; 7) using technical approaches to conservation and\u000asustainable management of forest resources; and 8)\u000aintroducing predictable and sustainable long-term financing mechanisms."

        "A pattern of forest area loss followed\u000aby a period of reforestation is representative of the forest\u000atransition process. Forest transition has been observed in\u000amany countries and is a feature of the development process.\u000aChina reached its inflection point earlier and faster than\u000amost other countries that have gone through the transition.\u000aThe report describes the success of reforms to forest\u000aresource tenure in collective forest areas. These reforms,\u000awhich collectively amount to the largest transfer of forest\u000aassets in history, have effectively extended forest\u000aownership to a million, mostly poor, rural households. These\u000areforms have increased forest-based incomes, have increased\u000atimber harvests, and have done so sustainably by virtue of\u000aincreasing planting and forest management and resource\u000aprotection effort. The World Bank work in China's\u000aforestry sector has been successful. However, the\u000adevelopments discussed in this report raise new\u000aopportunities and challenges. It is no longer clear, for\u000aexample, that World Bank loans are especially important in\u000arelation to the financing of commercial plantations. While\u000athe Bank has begun to move its plantation financing to\u000apublic goods, or ecological plantings, these are other\u000aopportunities. This report brings together findings from\u000aBank-supported studies with experience gleaned from Bank\u000asupport of over $1 billion in forestry projects. Chapter one\u000aintroduces the contents and approach of the report. Chapter\u000atwo summarizes key data and information of China's\u000aforest sector and resources. Chapter three presents findings\u000aon collective forest tenure reform and chapter four,\u000apotential forest supply. Chapter five concludes with\u000afindings to clarify choices and options available to the\u000aWorld Bank and China for moving ahead in forestry."

        "A pattern of forest area loss followed\u000aby a period of reforestation is representative of the forest\u000atransition process. Forest transition has been observed in\u000amany countries and is a feature of the development process.\u000aChina reached its inflection point earlier and faster than\u000amost other countries that have gone through the transition.\u000aThe report describes the success of reforms to forest\u000aresource tenure in collective forest areas. These reforms,\u000awhich collectively amount to the largest transfer of forest\u000aassets in history, have effectively extended forest\u000aownership to a million, mostly poor, rural households. These\u000areforms have increased forest-based incomes, have increased\u000atimber harvests, and have done so sustainably by virtue of\u000aincreasing planting and forest management and resource\u000aprotection effort. The World Bank work in China's\u000aforestry sector has been successful. However, the\u000adevelopments discussed in this report raise new\u000aopportunities and challenges. It is no longer clear, for\u000aexample, that World Bank loans are especially important in\u000arelation to the financing of commercial plantations. While\u000athe Bank has begun to move its plantation financing to\u000apublic goods, or ecological plantings, these are other\u000aopportunities. This report brings together findings from\u000aBank-supported studies with experience gleaned from Bank\u000asupport of over $1 billion in forestry projects. Chapter one\u000aintroduces the contents and approach of the report. Chapter\u000atwo summarizes key data and information of China's\u000aforest sector and resources. Chapter three presents findings\u000aon collective forest tenure reform and chapter four,\u000apotential forest supply. Chapter five concludes with\u000afindings to clarify choices and options available to the\u000aWorld Bank and China for moving ahead in forestry."
