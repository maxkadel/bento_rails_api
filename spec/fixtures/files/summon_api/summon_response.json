        "In 1994, the Government of Cameroon\u000aintroduced an array of forest policy reforms, both\u000aregulatory and market-based, to support a more organized,\u000atransparent, and sustainable system for accessing and using\u000aforest resources.

The intention is\u000ato provide a brief account of a complex process and identify\u000awhat worked, what did not, and what can be improved. The\u000abarriers to placing Cameroon's forests at the service\u000aof its people, its economy, and the environment originated\u000awith the extractive policies of successive colonial\u000aadministrations. The barriers were further consolidated\u000aafter independence through a system of political patronage\u000aand influence in which forest resources became a coveted\u000acurrency for political support. These deeply entangled\u000acommercial and political interests have only recently, and\u000areluctantly, started to diverge.

        "A report on agricultural expansion, environmental concerns in tropical forests, and poverty reduction, and how ecological, economic, and political aspects of tropical forests vary widely at both large and small scales. The spatial variation in deforestation and forest poverty is confronted by the author and the integration of results from recent econometric studies along with institutional studies finds that there is weak evidence of a causal link between deforestation and poverty, challenging conventional wisdom. Tables, Figures, Appendixes, References.",
        "There are many causes, consequences, and\u000aconnections of deforestation and forest poverty in the\u000atropical world. This report specifically addresses the\u000apotential dilemma of trade-offs between poverty reduction\u000aand environmental protection. It seeks to improve the\u000adiagnosis of forest problems and facilitate the prescription\u000aand application of solutions by focusing on both the causes\u000aand consequences of forest conversion to agriculture and on\u000athe nature and location of forest poverty. The first section\u000ais diagnostic, examining the drivers and consequences of\u000adeforestation and forest poverty. The second part looks at\u000ahow governance, institutions, and policies shape those\u000adrivers. It identifies opportunities for win-win policies.\u000aIn particular, anything that boosts labor demand outside\u000aagriculture will tend to reduce both poverty and\u000adeforestation. Additionally, promotion of some kinds of\u000aagroforestry can help to improve the ecological functions of\u000adegraded forests while boosting farm output and employment.\u000aThe report offers a systematic framework for thinking about\u000ahow to integrate forest management with rural development in\u000aa sustainable way."

        "Greater knowledge and transparency are often promoted as the keys to solving a wide array of governance problems. In Instituting Nature, Andrew Mathews describes Mexico's efforts over the past hundred years to manage its forests through forestry science and biodiversity conservation. He shows that transparent knowledge was produced not by official declarations or scientists' expertise but by encounters between the relatively weak forestry bureaucracy and the indigenous people who manage and own the pine forests of Mexico. Mathews charts the performances, collusions, complicities, and evasions that characterize the forestry bureaucracy. He shows that the authority of forestry officials is undermined by the tension between local realities and national policy; officials must juggle sweeping knowledge claims and mundane concealments, ambitious regulations and routine rule breaking. Moving from government offices in Mexico City to forests in the state of Oaxaca, Mathews describes how the science of forestry and bureaucratic practices came to Oaxaca in the 1930s and how local environmental and political contexts set the stage for local resistance. He tells how the indigenous Zapotec people learned the theory and practice of industrial forestry as employees and then put these skills to use when they become the owners and managers of the area's pine forests--eventually incorporating forestry into their successful claims for autonomy from the state. Despite the apparently small scale and local contexts of this balancing act between the power of forestry regulations and the resistance of indigenous communities, Mathews shows that it has large implications--for how we understand the modern state, scientific knowledge, and power and for the global carbon markets for which Mexican forests might become valuable.
